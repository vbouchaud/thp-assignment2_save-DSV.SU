0.4.6 - Enhanced shell.pl to include a working directory array, makes pwd 
and cd work. Added wget, more flexible uname (with -a, -s, -m, -v), w, and 
support for semicolon separated command list.

0.4.5 (not released) - Added Time::HiRes as the best method of pulling good 
timestamps. Moved thpfunc.pl into ~thp/lib. Improvements to iptables script, 
primarily to fix a firewall logging bug.
Chris Corella : Added (thp.conf)$uname mostly to simulate how easy it is to 
add shell like capabilities. Added (shell.pl) select LOG;$|=1; to set LOG to
currently selected output filehandler, and flush buffer on all PRINT 
statements to LOG. Added (shell.pl) uname -a, nad whoami functionality, see 
first comment. Added (all handlers) select LOG; $|=1; code

0.4.4 - Lots of changes here! Capture logs now include src address & port
of attacker. Selectable in the config file, capture log entries on a 
single-line, syslog-style, suitable for machine parsing. Check the comments
for certain implications of choosing this option.
I changed the directory layout a bit with this release. In the $thpdir/lib
directory are the individual functions libs, as well as other response
files.  Http.pl is completely rewritten, with the goal of rfc2616 compliance 
whenever possible. It includes errors 414, 501, 400 & 414, correctly built
http return headers for several file types, chameleon mode - to change its
responses (if turned on) to respond like an IIS machine when an attacker
requests certain types of resources, and several other features. It is 
useable (if you are a little deranged) as a lightweight webserver with a
flat directory structure.

0.4.3-2 - adjusted xinetd.d file port numbers & removed o-x on conf files
(pr0ps to Bill Scherr), added GOODNET & GOODSVCS to INPUT chain, added a 
section to iptables.rules to allow a multi-homed system to trust either an
entire interface, or just a trusted network. Added a test to bomb out if
someone accidentaly runs iptables.rules as-is on a machine that is a router.
Fixed escapes & array references in ftp() that were causing some versions 
of Perl to complain.

0.4.3-1 - Fixed extra shell prompt on exit, added GPL blurb to all files 
(thanks to Scot Wilcoxon for pointing this out), removed duplicate xinetd.d
 files from the tarball (sorry folks), iptables script requires less post-
install tweaking for hpot_svcs, moved port range for listeners to 40k+ to 
avoid conflicts with fakerpc, several other little tweaks & bugfixes.

0.4.3 - Added session timeouts, simple http emul, pid on caplog start line
 (you can now easily correlate with xinetd logging), xinetd per-source lim
its by default.

0.4.2-2 - Tweaked ftp some more, added a thp.conf switch to allow genuine
data connections for ftp, thus STOR functions and deposits the file(s) 
uploaded into the hpot directory. LIST & RETR just get junk via greetbin. 
Provided for a silent listener (no prompt or greeting). Various 
housekeeping. 

0.4.2-1 - Tweaked ftp a bit, pasv, port, list, retr now do something.

0.4.2 - Added an ftp responder in thpfunc.pl. Improved session naming by 
using the syscall gettimeofday and concatenating seconds & usecs in hex, 
with a fallback to the old method. Added a nullresponder sub to 
thpfunc.pl.

0.4.1 - Due to a piss poor job of input validation (none), thus the ease 
with which an intruder could execute arbitrary commands as user "nobody", 
I have begun a rewrite in Perl, taking a little better care in examining (
or not evaluating at all) any external data exchanges. Broke things up 
into thp.cfg (config stuff), thpfunc.pl (functions lib), and relegated 
logthis to dealing with start/stop logging & calling the service-specific 
subroutines (not there yet).

0.3.2 - Extended iptables script to simplify multiple hpot_svcs.  
Clarified and enhanced iptables support for permitted (trusted) networks 
and/or services. Started playing with thpsvcs, to provide believeable 
responses to simple initial commands. ftp is the only one in there now, 
more to come.

0.3.1 - Some xinetds don't like the config file name xinetd.hpot, so I 
renamed it to simply hpot. Added the necessary iptables lines to allow 
local -> external & return trip traffic.  Fixed README (yeah, right).

0.3 - First real build.  Prior versions were local cob-jobs. I figure 0.3 
is about right.
